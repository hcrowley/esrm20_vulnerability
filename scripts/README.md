# Vulnerability Modeller's Toolkit


The scripts in the 'scripts/vmtk' folder are from GEM's Vulnerability Modeller's Toolkit (Martins et al., 2021).  The original code can be obtained from: https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/VMTK-Vulnerability-Modellers-ToolKit (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5019331). 

This folder also contains the ground motion recordings and damping assumptions used for the European seismic vulnerability models.

Users interested in reproducing the European fragility models should copy or clone this whole scripts repository, and then run the 'run_nonlinear-dynamic_regression.py' script. This script runs nonlinear dynamic analysis of SDOF models built using the capacity curves in the 'ESRM20_capacity_curves' folder, and applies censored regression to the results. All results are stored in the 'vmtk/outputs' folder.

The script 'esrm20_fragility_postprocess.py' reads the regression parameters and damage thresholds (in the 'vmtk/outputs/regression' folder) and uses these to calculate the median and dispersion of lognormal fragility functions, which are saved in the .xlsx file 'esrm_fraglity_various_IM_lognormal.xlsx' 

The script 'esrm20_total-repl-cost_vulnerability_postprocess.py' computes vulnerability functions (for direct economic losses as a percentage of replacement cost) using the fragility functions.
