# ESRM20 Capacity Curves

This repository contains all of the capacity curves being used in the development of vulnerability models for ESRM20.

The format of the .csv files:

Row 1 = cracking

Row 2 = yield

Row 3 = peak strength

Row 4 = ultimate displacement

Column 1,3,... = spectral displacement (metres)

Column 2,4,... = spectral acceleration (g)
 

The capacity curves for CR_LDUAL, CR_LWAL, MCF, MR, MUR, S and W typologies have been obtained from the following study:
 Martins and Silva (2020), DOI: 10.1007/s10518-020-00885-1, data available at: https://github.com/lmartins88/global_fragility_vulnerability. There is only one capacity curve per typology (representing the median capacity). 

The capacity curves for CR_LFM and CR_LFINF have been developed during the Horizon 2020 SERA project (www.sera-eu.org). More details are available here: http://eu-risk.eucentre.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SERA_D26.5_Physical_Vulnerability.pdf. Note that there are multiple capacity curves per typology, thus explicitly accounting for building-to-building variability.

The building typologies are described using the GEM Building Taxonomy with the attributes summarised below:

(1) Materials. CR: reinforced concrete, MR: reinforced masonry, MCF: confined masonry, MUR: unreinforced masonry, MUR-ADO: adobe, MUR-CB99: concrete block masonry, MUR-CL99: clay brick masonry, MUR-STDRE: dressed stone masonry, MUR-STRUB: rubble stone masonry, S: steel, W: wood/timber

(2) Lateral load resisting systems. LDUAL: dual frame-wall system, LFINF: infilled frame, LWAL: load bearing wall, LFM: moment frame, LFBR: braced frame

(3) Code Level or Ductility. CDN: absence of seismic design, CDL: low code level (designed for lateral resistance using allowable stress design), CDM: moderate code level (designed for lateral resistance with modern limit state design), CDH: high code level (designed for lateral resistance coupled with target ductility requirements and capacity design), DNO: non-ductile, DUL: low ductility, DUM: moderate ductility, DUH: high ductility

(4) Height. H: number of storeys

(5) Lateral Force Coefficient. The value of the lateral force coefficient, i.e. the fraction of the weight that was specified as the design lateral force in the seismic design code (see Code Level), expressed in % (applied to reinforced concrete moment and infilled frames only)
