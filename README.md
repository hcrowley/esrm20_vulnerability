# European Building Vulnerability Database

This is a public repository that contains data and resources on European building vulnerability, including the final vulnerability models used for the European Seismic Risk Model 2020 (ESRM20).

Please consult the 'WhatsNew.txt' file for a summary of the data released with each version of the repository.

Each version of the European Vulnerability Database that is released can be accessed by changing from the 'Master' branch to the tag of a given version. The Master branch contains the work-in-progress of the next version of the repository.

If you would like to highlight any errors or contribute new data to the European Building Vulnerability Database please contact feedback.eu-risk@eucentre.it. If you are familiar with 'git' you may clone the repository, produce a local branch within which to make your changes to the database, and then submit a merge request (with a description of the modifications you have made).
