# European Building Vulnerability Database

This is a public repository that contains data and resources on European building vulnerability, including the final vulnerability models used for the European Seismic Risk Model 2020 (ESRM20).

'European_Building_Vulnerability_Database.xlsx' contains a summary of capacity curves, fragility functions, vulnerability functions and damage-loss models for European buildings obtained from the literature. The ESRM20 fragility and vulnerability models are not included in this Excel sheet but are reported separately in 'esrm20_fragility_various_IM_lognormal.xlsx' and 'esrm20_vulnerability_total-repl-cost.xlsx'.

'ESRM20_capacity_curves' contains the capacity curves that have been used to develop these fragility and vulnerability models for ESRM20.

'scripts' contains the open source code that has been used to develop the ESRM20 fragility and vulnerability models. 

Please consult the 'WhatsNew.txt' file for a summary of the data released with each version of the repository.

Each version of the European Building Vulnerability Database that is released can be accessed by changing from the 'Master' branch to the tag of a given version. The Master branch contains the work-in-progress of the next version of the repository.

If you would like to highlight any errors or contribute new data to the European Building Vulnerability please send an email to 'efehr.risk@sed.ethz.ch'.
